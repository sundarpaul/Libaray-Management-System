# Libaray-Management-System

The project is developed using java and MySQL. This project is useful for student and facility members to mange books. Here a admin can add & delete books and students. Admin can also view the log of the actions performed and a easy track of books & students. Here a student can search books and barrow or return books and also see his own log.
